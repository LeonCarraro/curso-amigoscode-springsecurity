# Spring Security - Form Login + JWT

This project was my first experience with Spring Security and JWT, but it was a very important starting point for learning how to implement security in APIs.
So I am posting the completed project here and I take the opportunity to leave a piece of advice:<br><br>
Who is starting to learn how to implement security in APIs and is having difficulties, just like I did, watch this course created and made available by Nelson 
from the Amigoscode channel on youtube. The way he teaches is very easy to understand and you left with much more knowledge to delve into more advanced topics on 
Spring Security<br><br>
